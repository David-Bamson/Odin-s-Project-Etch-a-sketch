Had doubts before i started this etch a sketch project, genuinely thought this would take a very long time  because they themsleves said it was going to be hard, not going to lie again , AI played a major role in me getting past this one , especially when it came to the random color aspect,
overall i made use of 4 functions , 1 generates random colors for the boxes, 1 darkens the boxes, 1 generates the boxes, and the last one keeps tabs on the boxes to check if they have been hoverd on or how many timesthey have been hovered on 
Little html and css to make the UI a little more friendly , feeling under the weather right now so i am going to cut this readme short , it wa a fun and humbling experience , 100% would do it again 
stay blessed!
